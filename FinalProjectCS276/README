This is a game of Memory Match! The goal of the mini-game is to turn over two cards at a time that are matches. Each set of cards you turn over decreases your “Turns Left” by one, so be careful of how many non-matches you turn over. Completing the mini-game within the number of maximum turns will allow for you to gain more friendship with the owner of the jewelry stand!

To turn over a card, simply click on the back of the card! The front of the card will be revealed after it is clicked on. Then, click over your second card, and if it is a match, they will both disappear from the screen! If the level is failed, click on the restart button and try again.
